💖 HeartEcho 
An echo of you — across time, space, and soul.

HeartEcho is a poetic fusion of emotional intelligence, storytelling, and cultural data — designed as a web experience where users discover who they are, echoed across time.
At its core, HeartEcho is a personalized narrative generator that creates three unique personas (or “Echo Twins”) based on a user’s tastes, emotions, and personality.
